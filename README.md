# peak-raid-results

This small project automatically downloads separate results from the [Peak Raid Maprun series](http://explorerevents.co.uk/map-run/) and combines points and time scores for each competitor. It then ranks competitors by overall number of points and time taken.

The combined results are available here:
- [HTML](http://qdata.uk/peak_raid_maprun_2022_results.html)
- [CSV](http://qdata.uk/peak_raid_maprun_2022_results.csv)

I have this script running daily on a Raspberry Pi so the results stay up to date automatically.
